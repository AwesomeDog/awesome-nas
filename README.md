# What is NAS?

> **Network-attached storage** (**NAS**) is a file-level (as opposed
> to [block-level storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage "Block-level storage")) [computer data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage")
> server connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network")
> providing  
> data access to a [heterogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing "Heterogeneous computing")
> group  
> of clients. The term "NAS" can refer to both the technology and systems involved, or a specialized device built for
> such  
> functionality (as unlike tangentially related technologies such  
> as [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network"), a NAS device is often
> a singular unit).
